# Language app for learning english words (for finnish kids)

This application is designed for finnish kids and teachers to support learning english.
The application has 2 modes, for students and for teachers.
Students can pick a category they wish to practice words from and start training.
Students are presented with multi-choice questions and they have to choose
the correct translation for the word in question.

In teacher mode the teacher can add new words with translation and a tag to the external database
which creates new learning material.

This is a fullstack project that uses React.js in the frontend and Node.js with Express.js library
in the backend.
